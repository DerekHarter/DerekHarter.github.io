I am currently a professor of Computer Science at [Texas A&M
University](http://www.tamuc.edu) in Commerce, TX.  The [Computer
Science Department at TAMUC](http://www.tamuc.edu/cs) offers
undergraduate degree programs in Computer Science and Computer
Information Systems, as well as teaching certificates for primary
school teachers of Computer science.  For our Masters graduate program,
we offer degrees in traditional Computer Science, and a degree in
Computational Sciences, which focuses on interdisciplinary
scientific comput, modeling and data analytics.

My primary research interests are in deep learning, machine learning
in general and in understanding human and animal cognition using
neural network models and network science based models of intelligent
systems.  I also have research interests in HCI, learning and other
areas of Psychology and Cognitive Science.  Currently I mainly teach
courses in deep learning, data analytics, operating systems and
programming, and introduction to computational science and statistical
methods for scientific computing.

You may find more information about my research, publications and
classes using the links provided above.  Many of my classes and some
research work can be found in my Bitbucket or Github repositories as
well.
