This course provides an introductory framework for the statistical
background required for scientific computation and data analysis. The
course introduces fundamental statistical concepts such as
probability, random variables, probability distributions, statistical
expectation, sampling distributions, hypothesis testing, linear
regression, correlation, and visualization/plotting of data, with
emphasis on applications to scientific computing and computational
science problems. Concepts will be reinforced by having students use a
statistical/scientific computing & visualization software in order
to apply the concepts that they learn by solving problems from various
disciplines.
