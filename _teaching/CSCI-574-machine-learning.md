This semester's AI course will focus on the sub field of machine
learning with some work in the analysis of big data.  We will look at
classic unsupervised and supervised learning methods, used in the
field to classify data, cluster it and find optimizations.  This will
include looking at k-means and hierarchical clustering,
self-organizing maps, linear regression, decision trees, optimization
techniques such as genetic algorithms, etc.  We will cover ways of
getting hold of interesting datasets, ideas on how to collect data
from users, and many different ways to analyze and understand the data
once you've found it.

- Explore downloading and mining real web data sets.
- Learn about unsupervised methods for grouping and visualization.
- Program optimization algorithms to search for optimal solutions
  using hill climbing, GA's, etc.
- Become familiar with some advanced classification techniques of the
  kernel methods family of algorithms.
