In this course the theory and practice of neural computation for
machine learning are introduced. Artificial neural networks are used
for many real-world problems: classification, time-series prediction,
regression, pattern recognition. The class starts with an introduction
to feed forward neural networks.  More complicated multi-layered
"deep" networks are then covered.  Basic backpropagation, gradient
descent and modern regularization techniques are implemented in
assignments. The class will look at modern deep learning techniques:
convolutional neural networks, deep belief networks and deep recurrent
neural models such as LSTM nets.  Readings and current results from
the literature on neural network research will be discussed.
