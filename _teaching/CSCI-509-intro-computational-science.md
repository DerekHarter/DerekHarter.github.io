Big scientific data sets are growing exponentially both in size and
complexity. Extracting meaningful information from this data requires
not only programming skills, but also understanding the analysis
work-flows and mathematical models and visualization tools that help
to condense large amounts of information into a comprehensible
story. Computational science is the scientific investigation of
problems through modeling, simulation and analysis of physical
processes on a computer.  Computational science is now considered by
most scientists to be on par with the development of scientific theory
and the use of experimentation in order to understand more about our
world.  Computational science is not the same as computer science.
Rather, it is an interdisciplinary blend of scientific models, applied
mathematics, computational techniques, and practices.  This
Introduction to Computational Science course focuses upon simple and
intuitive computational models and methods.
