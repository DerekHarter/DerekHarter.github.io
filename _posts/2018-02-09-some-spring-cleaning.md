Doing some much overdue spring cleaning on my personal website.
Used to use Wordpress on my personal domain servers, but it was
always a bit too over-heavy for my needs, and had suffered
dreadfully from bitrot.

Trying out using [this](https://academicpages.github.io/) system,
which allows management through more simple markdown files for most
content.  I will be using a combination of simple markdown and LaTeX
with BibTeX bibliographies to try and keep my personal home page and
research/teaching/publication records up to date.
